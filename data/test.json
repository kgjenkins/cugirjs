As a result, DOC adopted the 1:24,000 (24K) scale U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) dataset (USGS source) for their Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) but with several modifications. Detailed documentation of these changes is provided by FMMP and included in the lineage section of the metadata.  A dataset named cnty24k97_1 was made available (approximately 2004) through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection - Fire and Resource Assessment Program (CDF - FRAP) and the California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL).\n\nIn late 2006, the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) reviewed cnty24k97_1.  Comparisons were made to a high-quality 100K dataset (co100a/county100k from the former Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group) and legal boundary descriptions from ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov ).  The cnty24k97_1 dataset was missing Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands.  DFG added the missing islands using previously-digitized coastline data (coastn27 of State Lands Commission origin), corrected a few county boundaries, built region topology, added additional attributes, and renamed the dataset to county24k.\n\nIn 2007, the California Mapping Coordinating Committee (CMCC) requested that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) resume stewardship of the statewide county boundaries data.  CAL FIRE adopted the changes made by DFG and collected additional suggestions for the county data from DFG, DOC, and local government agencies.  CAL FIRE incorporated these suggestions into the latest revision, which has been renamed cnty24k09_1.  Detailed documentation of changes is included in the Process Step section of the metadata.",

The features in this layer are based on database information provided to MassGIS from the DPH, Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS). The August 2009 update of this dataset limited the features to include only acute care hospitals (and removed other \"specialty hospitals\"; it replaces the layer formerly known as \"Hospitals and Emergency Room Facilities.\"  The August 2009 update kept the ER status data and also added attributes to track the status of trauma centers and teaching hospitals. OEMS defines these attributes as follows:\n\n  - Emergency Rooms provide emergency service to those in need of immediate medical care in order to prevent loss of life or aggravation of physiological or psychological illness or injury.\n\n  - Trauma Center: a hospital verified by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) as a level 1, 2 or 3 adult trauma center, or a level 1 or 2 pediatric trauma center, as defined in the document ‘Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient: 1999’ by the Trauma Subcommittee of the American College of Surgeons and its successors; and meets applicable Department standards for designation, or a hospital that has applied for and is in the process of verification as specified in 130.851 and meets applicable Department standards for designation.\n\n  - Teaching Status: a hospital defined according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s (MedPAC) definition of a major teaching hospital: at least 25 full time equivalent medical school residents per one hundred inpatient beds.\n\nStored in ArcSDE, the layer is named HOSPITALS_PT.\n\nPlease be aware that because of possible frequent updates, this layer should not be the primary source when seeking emergency care.

It represents locations of all properties sold in New York City. Several Python scripts were written to read-in each borough's sales data and combine them into sales for New York City as whole. NYC Geoclient API, developed by NYC DOITT, was used in a script to geocode locations of the properties sold. Locations geocoded by the script were matched by property address or by property block and lot information, if the address was missing or incomplete. For some properties lot information has changed from the year of the property sale (e.g. lot has been split and renumbered) and doesn’t exist in the city's current property and address database. Manual matching was performed for those records by examining archival tax maps. Due to the vertical nature of the real estate market in New York, multiple points / transactions may coincide in the same location. The coordinate reference system for this layer is NY State Plane Long Island in feet. The unique identifier of the dataset is Sale_id. Bbl_id is a unique identifier for the property and may repeat in the dataset if the property was sold more than once in the same year. The user should be cautious of sales with values less than $10 or equal to $0, which are marked as non-usable in this dataset. These sales are transfers of property and are not considered representative of true market conditions. This layer was created as a part of the NYC Geocoded Real Estate Sales data series.",

States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products.
