# #1 switch to geojson index maps

With OpenIndexMaps geojson data in the browser, we can:

show data availability by using different colors
label or add tooltips for each mapsheet
search for a mapsheet by name or id
better calculate which mapsheet is clicked, without having to make a WFS call
better track which mapsheets have been selected for download


# #5 clip and ship

Since generated downloads are handled via WFS, allow users to select a bbox on the map to download a clipped dataset.


# #6 attribute help

When displaying attribute info for a clicked feature, mousing over an attribute name should display the attribute definition from the FGDC metadata.


# #9 add filters

similar to current CUGIR site

"data filters" button

Filter or browse by:

- category
- year
- author
- collection
- place
- data type


# NEW page layout

Move download links and attributes to the far right? or is that too far away from the map?
