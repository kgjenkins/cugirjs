Where obvious discrepancies occurred, Adirondack Park Agency cartographers re-plotted the boundary at 1:24000 scale using visual reference points on the maps and then re-digitized.

        "dc_description_s":"This file was created using the MesoMap system which consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for simple localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. Truewind subsequently validates the wind maps. The final product is a grid of cells each containing a single value of average wind speed (m/s) at a hub height of 70 meters, for a 40,000 square meter area.  The purpose of creating this file was to use MesoMap to create high-resolution wind resource maps of the state and to provide wind resource data in a format enabling the assessesment potential wind development sites in a GIS. By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites.",

Butterfly occurrence data are cumulative, so positive occurrence data do not necessarily imply current residence of the species. Most records are from the last 30 to 40 years, with a few records that date from as early as the late 1800's.  These data are intended for use in publications at a scale of 1:2,000,000 or smaller. Due to the small scale, the primary use is for regional and national data display and analysis, rather than specific local data analysis. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",

        "dc_description_s":"A set of 18 USGS 7.5' quadrangle-based wetland coverages was prepared for the Oswegatchie-Black, Upper Hudson, and St. Regis River watersheds, primarily within the New York State Adirondack Park using PC Arc/Info 3.4D+ at the Remote Sensing Laboratory, Plattsburgh State University (RSL). Wetlands were delineated on 1:40000 color infrared National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) transparencies (for the Oswegatchie-Black watershed 1:58,000-scale National High Altitude Photography (NHAP) color infrared photos were used), transferred to orthophoto overlays using an Image Interpretations Systems Stereo Zoom Transfer Scope, and either hand digitized or scanned into PC Arc/Info format. A digital file extracted from the watershed data layer defined the outer boundary of the mapped area. This wetlands database consists of both polygon and linear features labeled using National Wetlands Inventory conventions. The 138 individual quadrangle files were exported to the New York State, Executive Department, Adirondack Park Agency (NYS APA) running Arc/Info version 8.0. The final MAPJOINED study area polygon coverage comprised of the 18 quad coverages was called STREGWTLND. Scale 1:24,000.  The wetlands database is part of a larger database designed to help evaluate watershed/wetland relationships and provide data for cumulative impact assessments. The outreach efforts to share the Agency's natural resource database will encourage resource appreciation and wise use, particularly in a regional context. Supplemental Information: Line drawings for 18 quadrangle-based wetland coverages were scanned using an ANAtech Evolution scanner housed at the Adirondack Park Agency. Digital files were vectorized, transformed into the UTM coordinate system, edited, and attributed by the Remote Sensing Laboratory, Plattsburgh State University. Digital files were georeferenced into a digital quadrangle file containing four bounding tics using PC Arc/Info 3.4D+. Maximum allowable RMS was 0.003, snapdistance 20.0 meters, snaptype closest, weed tolerance 3.0 meters, and a fuzzy tolerance of 1.219 meters. Hard copies of the digital coverage showing arcs, dangle nodes, and label points were carefully checked against the line overlay for digitizing or scanning accuracy. Wetland labels were added as label components using a digitizer menu customized for this project. A label overlay was placed over the line drawing, and arc and wetland labels were assigned on the digitizer. Wetland label columns were concatenated into a unified wetland label using dBase IV. A hard copy of the wetland coverage was made showing NWI wetland labels and each label was checked against the label overlay. Wetland labels follow the conventions established by Cowardin, L.M., V. Carter, F.C. Golet, and E.T. LaRoe. 1979. Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States. FWS/OBS-79/31. Office of Biological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 103 pp. Some modifications to the conventions were made to accommodate this project and are noted in the final project report. Files were transported to the NYS APA as Arc/Info export files (no compression) compressed with WinZip on 100 MB Zip disks.",

The imagery was collected between May 4, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New York. This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University. The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000. There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers: http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm  The purpose of the Cropland Data Layer Program is to use satellite imagery to (1) provide supplemental acreage estimates for the state's major commodities and (2) produce digital, crop specific, categorized geo-referenced output products. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state level. The cropland data layers are provided \"as is\". USDA-NASS does not warrant results you may obtain using the data.",

        "dc_description_s":"This dataset is a digital representation of the King and Beikman map. In 1974 the U.S. Geological Survey published a new Geologic Map of the United States (exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii) on a scale of 1:2,500,000, which was compiled between 1967 and 1971 by Philip B. King and Helen M. Beikman, with geologic cartography by Gertrude J. Edmonston.  (from King and Beikman, 1974b) The map displays the rocky foundations on which our of investigation of this foundation by a succession of geologists. It is thus a reference work that present and future geologists of the country can consult and is of prime importance in the education of earth scientists in schools and colleges. Further, it can be consulted by geologists in other countries and continents who wish to learn about the geology of the United States; they will compare the map with similar national or continental maps of their own countries. In terms of resources useful to man, the Geologic Map lays out accurately the major regions of bedrock in New York State upon which many facets of our economy depend. It illustrates the areas of stratified rocks that are the sources of most of our fuels, and the areas of crystalline, plutonic, and volcanic rocks that contain important parts of mineral wealth. The map shows areas of complex folding and faulting, parts of which are still tectonically unstable and subject to earthquake hazards. To some extent the bedrock represented on the map also influences surface soils, which are of interest in agriculture and engineering works. Beyond this, the practical value of the map is less tangible, although it can be an important tool for the discerning user. Clearly, the map will not pinpoint the location of the next producing oil well or the next bonanza mine, nor will it give specific advice for the location of a dam or reactor site; these needs can only be satisfied by maps on much larger scales, designed for specific purposes. Nevertheless, the sapient exploration geologist can find upon it significant regional features not apparent to the untrained user. Many great petroleum pools occur in stratigraphic traps, or \"wedge belts of porosity,\" caused by overlap or truncation, the regional occurrence of which can be seen on the map. Important mineral deposits cluster along regional tectonic trends or chains of plutons of specific ages. Finally, the Geologic Map will be used in national planning activities in conjunction with other national maps showing environmental features such as climate, vegetation, and land use --for the location of power transmission corridors, highways, National Parks, wilderness areas, reclamation projects, and the like.",

To map small scale land uses, high resolution aerial imagery available from the New York State Digital OrthoimageryProgram (NYSDOP) was interpreted by a trained GIS analyst according to a multi-tiered classification scheme similar to that used by Tompkins County, New York to map land use in 1995. To map large scale land uses and land cover types, two sets of Landsat Thematic Mapper images were analyzed. One set was analyzed by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Research and Development Division, and published as the Cropland Data Layer for the state of New York. To distinguish between different forest cover types, Landsat-5 TM images were radiometrically and geographically corrected, and analyzed using a supervised classification procedure. These separate layers were overlayed to produce the final vector layer.  This geographic dataset was developed by the Cayuga Lake Watershed Network as part of a larger project, in conjunction with Dr. Douglas Haith and Cornell University, to model nutrient loading in the Cayuga Lake watershed. The model used is the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (Haith and Shoemaker, 1987). Haith, D.A. and L.L. Shoemaker, 1987. Generalized Watershed Loading Functions for Stream Flow Nutrients.

Traditionally, land use and land cover maps have been developed by interpreting aerial photographs, delineating land use and land cover polygons onto a geo-referenced base map, and then digitizing the line work. This project uses an innovative methodology to develop a land use and land cover map entirely within a digital environment. Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQ), a type of color infra-red digital aerial photograph, and a number of other secondary digital data sources (wetlands, hydrology, and planimetric base data) are being used to interpret and delineate land use and land cover directly on-screen. This technique is more time efficient by reducing the number of processing steps required, as well as more accurate by reducing cumulative errors introduced through multiple processing steps. A land use and land cover classification system was designed to meet the needs of the users of these data. A needs assessment meeting was held prior to the project to determine the needs of planners, local municipalities, advisory boards and educators. In 1968, the Land Use and Natural Resource Inventory (LUNR) a state-wide land use and land cover mapping project, used aerial photographs to identify 130 land use and land cover classes.

The Tompkins County land use and land cover classification system has been designed to be comparable with the LUNR classification system. Comparable classification systems will enable users to analyze changes in land use and land cover over the previous thirty year time period.  Provides a county-wide data set of all land use and land cover classes in Tompkins County. Potential uses of these data include land use and land cover time change analysis, comprehensive planning and development suitability analysis.",

        "dc_description_s":"The National Land Cover Database 1992/2001 Change Product was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium, a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consists of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The goal of the project is to generate a current, consistent, and seamless 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Product for the United States at medium spatial resolution for Anderson Level 1 classes. This land cover change map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For detailed definitions and discussion of the NLCD 1992/2001 Change product, refer to <http://www.mrlc.gov/>. New developments in mapping methodology, new sources of input data, and minor differences between mapping legends in the 1992 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 1992) and the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001) have compounded any direct comparisons. NLCD 2001 method improvements have resulted in an improved land cover product over NLCD 1992 in such areas as classification accuracy, spatial detail, database content, and multiple product flexibility. The result is that direct comparison of these two independently created land cover products is not recommended. The 1992/2001 NLCD Land Cover Change Product was developed to offer a more accurate and useful guide to change analysis than can be provided by direct comparison of NLCD 1992 with NLCD 2001. Users are cautioned that this product is designed to be the most accurate for applications at the mapping zone scale, and is not designed to be accurately applied over smaller sub-mapping zone areas. The NLCD 1992/2001 Change Product is partitioned in the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Zone 13 (the northeastern U.S.) consists of mapping zones 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, and 66, which collectively encompasses the entirety of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, as well as portions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina.  The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on land cover change.",

        "dc_description_s":"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.  The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.",

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies, consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of the primary goals of the project was to generate a current, consistent, and seamless national land cover, percent tree canopy cover, and percent impervious cover at medium spatial resolution. TCC 2011 is the NLCD tree canopy cover dataset for CONUS at medium spatial resolution (30 m). It was produced by the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC). The TCC 2011 dataset has two layers: percent tree canopy cover and standard error. For the tree canopy cover layer, the pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent. For the standard error layer, the pixel values range from 0 to 45 percent. The standard error represents the model uncertainty associated with the corresponding pixel in the tree canopy cover layer. The tree canopy cover layer was produced using a Random Forests™ regression algorithm and the standard error layer was calculated from the variance of the canopy cover estimates from the random forest regression trees.  The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its tree canopy cover.",

This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered \"provisional\" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to <http://www.mrlc.gov/>. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Zone 13 (the northeastern U.S.) consists of mapping zones 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, and 66, which collectively encompasses the entirety of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, as well as portions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina.

The sediment type interpretation is based on the grain size analysis of the cores and grabs with some guidance from acoustic backscatter data collected with sidescan sonar. Sediment profile imagery (SPI) has also been used to supplement these interpretations. Since the first guide in developing this interpretation is contouring the results of the grain size interpretation there is deviation from the side scan images. In most research on sediments, grain size data is given in phi intervals rather than in microns, millimeters, or inches. One phi unit is equal to one Udden-Wentworth grade. Phi diameter is computed by taking the negative log of the diameter in millimeters. We have identified 9 major classes of sediment based on the Wentworth classification.  In 1996, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) initiated an effort to map the benthic habitat of the Hudson River Estuary as part of a larger Hudson River Action Plan. This project includes extensive mapping using sidescan sonar, sub-bottom profiling, single and multi-beam bathymetric sonars, as well as collecting ground truth data with sediment cores, grab samples, and sediment profiling imagery (SPI). The goal of the project is the creation of a comprehensive data set that includes detailed interpretive maps of the physical environment of the floor of the estuary.

The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of 19 ground meters of separation. Boundary separation is less than 19 meters in some park areas located in the Bronx River Watershed area, which reflects the high resolution of resource concern and management there. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO-certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:6,000 in the Bronx River Watershed area, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the 1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features (in the ?*_p? and ?*_l? feature classes).

The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of 19 ground meters of separation. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO- certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:4,800 in Gateway National Recreation Area, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the 1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features (in the \"*_p\" and \"*_l\" feature classes).

The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of 19 ground meters of separation. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO- certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:4,800 in Central Park, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the 1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features (in the \"*_p\" and \"*_l\" feature classes).

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.

This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. The soil map unit delineation boundaries are subject to a cartographic standard of 19 ground meters of separation. Compared to previous nonproject (non-SSURGO- certified) mapping that was conducted at 1:4,800 in Gateway National Recreation Area, the 1:12,000 scale mapping will appear to have less detail. However, the 1:12,000 SSURGO product represents the largest-scale official soils data published by the USDA-NRCS, and supersedes nonproject mapping at larger scales that appears to provide greater detail. In the process of correlating the mapping to a smaller scale, individual map unit delineations were combined (into complexes) and some features, especially wetter areas, small water bodies, or very narrow features (e.g. short steep slopes or escarpments), may be represented by special features (in the \"*_p\" and \"*_l\" feature classes).

It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

        "dc_description_s":"This data set consists of general soil association units. It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994 .It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined. Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.  These data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level.The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data.",

In addtion, the New York Sea Grant, the Hudson River Estuary Program, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are identified as partners. These groups provided diverse expertise to enable the first broad delimitation of SAV in the Hudson.  The project was undertaken in two separate time periods with different sources of funding. In 1995, Phase I (Hyde Park to Castleton) was initiated with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and Hudson River Foundation funds. Subsequently in 1997, the remaining portions (Hastings to Hyde Park and Castleton to Troy) were undertaken in Phase II with New York.

        "dc_description_s":"A small mollusk called the zebra mussel has been steadily invading America's rivers and lakes. Zebra mussels colonize water intake pipes and severely restrict the water flow. This has cost billions of dollars of damage to municipal and private facilities that rely on fresh water. This map layer shows the locations of confirmed zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to 1998. The sighting reports came from a variety of federal, State, and municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and private consultant firms, and businesses. The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel, (Dreissena polymorpha), within the United States resulted in passage of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological degradation. This data set is a compilation of reports of confirmed zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to the present. It provides geographical and historical information to show distribution over time. The reports came from a variety of federal, State, and municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and private consultant firms. The locations of confirmed sightings were registered at 1:100,000-scale on EPA Reach File Version 3.0 and are maintained as an Arc/INFO export file. This is a revised version of the June, 2000 data set.  The data is an essential part of the Department of the Interior's Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Species Program. The data was compiled for use by resource managers to make them aware of zebra mussel occurrences so that they may help to control or prevent the spread of zebra mussels. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
